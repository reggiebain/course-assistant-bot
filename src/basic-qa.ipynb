Topics include motion in one and two dimensions,  Newton’s laws of motion, equilibrium, work, energy, momentum, rotational motion,  gravity, heat, waves, and sound. Examples from medicine and biology will be  included whenever possible. 2. College Credit Hours (Dual-Enrollment) a. This course is dual enrolled with PHYS 215 General Physics I at Francis Marion  University (FMU) and taught by a GSSM instructor. Students will each have a FMU  transcript with their overall grade earned in this course. Students may earn up to 4  college credit hours depending on their grade and the transfer policies of their  college/university. Refer to the Dual Enrollment FAQ in the Course Catalog for  more information. 3. Learning Outcomes a. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:  b.

Apply the laws of classical Newtonian mechanics (motion, force, energy,  momentum, and gravitation) to solve problems involving static systems, motion  with constant acceleration, and rotational motion.  c. Use techniques of graphical analysis to classify and model physical phenomena and  apply physical meaning to mathematical techniques from algebra, pre-calculus, and  trigonometry.
