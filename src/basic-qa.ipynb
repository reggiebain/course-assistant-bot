      "I. Course Description 1. Course Summary a. PHY 161/PHYS 215 General Physics I is an algebra-based introduction to mechanics,  thermodynamics, and waves. Topics include motion in one and two dimensions,  Newton’s laws of motion, equilibrium, work, energy, momentum, rotational motion,  gravity, heat, waves, and sound. Examples from medicine and biology will be  included whenever possible. 2. College Credit Hours (Dual-Enrollment) a. This course is dual enrolled with PHYS 215 General Physics I at Francis Marion  University (FMU) and taught by a GSSM instructor. Students will each have a FMU  transcript with their overall grade earned in this course. Students may earn up to 4  college credit hours depending on their grade and the transfer policies of their  college/university. Refer to the Dual Enrollment FAQ in the Course Catalog for  more information. 3. Learning Outcomes a. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:  b.

      "Dual Enrollment FAQ in the Course Catalog for  more information. 3. Learning Outcomes a. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:  b. Apply the laws of classical Newtonian mechanics (motion, force, energy,  momentum, and gravitation) to solve problems involving static systems, motion  with constant acceleration, and rotational motion.  c. Use techniques of graphical analysis to classify and model physical phenomena and  apply physical meaning to mathematical techniques from algebra, pre-calculus, and  trigonometry.

Collect, analyze, and present scientiﬁc data through weekly labs, data-focused  problems, and technical writing tasks.  4. Pedagogy a. This course will help students develop key problem-solving and critical thinking skills  through a student-centered, active approach to learning. The course will incorporate  guided, inquiry-based activities, group problem-solving, and peer-instruction in order to  promote active student engagement. II. Laboratory 1. Learning Outcomes a.

Assignments a. Students will complete weekly lab assignments that will be written in Google Docs and  utilize Google Sheets extensively. Most labs will be submitted electronically to Canvas but  some will be written by hand. Some activities will require students to work in groups of  3-4 and others will require students to turn in work individually.
