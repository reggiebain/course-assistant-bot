"a.
Group 
vs. 
Individual 
Work: 
Students
are
encouraged
to
work
together
with
classmates
but
must
ensure
that
they
gain
their
own
individual
understanding
of
material.
Students
must

time
for

others.
b.
Don’t 
Procrastinate: 
I
recommend
that
students
make
time
each
day
to
work
on
problem
sets
in
advance
of
the
deadline.
Cramming
the
night
before
an
assignment

is
an
ineﬀective
way
to
learn

will
result

Physics
demands
a
daily,
systematic,
and
focused
approach
to
studying.

unless
they
have
excused
absences.
The

and
others
will
require
students
to
turn

Academic
integrity
is
“a
commitment,

the
face
of
adversity,
to
six
fundamental
values:
honesty,
trust,
fairness,
respect,
responsibility,
and
courage”
(International

A
lack
of
academic
integrity
prevents
students
from

and
undermines
our
community,
and
is
therefore
strictly
prohibited.
GSSM’s

(as
explained
in

GSSM
Student
Handbook)
covers
all

Students
may
work
