","The primary textbook for the course is Physics: Principles with Applications, 7th ed., by Douglas C. Giancoli.",/kaggle/input/course-bot-data/documents/rbain_syllabus.pdf,5.0,"The context clearly states that the primary textbook for the course is 'Physics: Principles with Applications, 7th ed., Douglas C. Giancoli' and that a physical copy is provided to students. Therefore, the question is clearly and unambiguously answerable with the context.
",3.0,"This question is useful for students who are taking a course and want to know what textbook they need to purchase or read in order to follow along with the course material. It is also useful for instructors who are designing a course and want to ensure that their chosen textbook aligns with the course content. However, this question is not directly related to machine learning developers building NLP applications with the Hugging Face ecosystem, so it may not be as useful for that specific audience.

",5.0,"This question is context-independent, as it refers to a common concept in education, a textbook, and asks for the primary one for a course. The course is not specified, but this does not affect the understanding of the question.

"
"a.
Group 
vs. 
Individual 
Work: 
Students
are
encouraged
to
work
together
with
classmates
but
must
ensure
that
they
gain
their
own
individual
understanding
of
material.
Students
must
allot
time
for
self-study
alone
without
others.
b.
Don‚Äôt 
Procrastinate: 
I
recommend
that
students
make
time
each
day
to
work
on
problem
sets
in
advance
of
the
deadline.
Cramming
the
night
before
an
assignment
or
exam
is
an
ineÔ¨Äective
way
to
learn
physics
and
will
result
in
poor
test
scores.
Physics
demands
a
daily,
systematic,
and
focused
approach
to
studying.
c.
Practice 
makes 
perfect: 
Solving
physics
problems
is
a
skill
that
requires
practice.
It
is
NOT
a
game
of
memorizing
equations
or
solutions
to
speciÔ¨Åc
problems.

a.
Attending
Class:
Students
are

to
attend
all
of
their
classes
and
labs
at
GSSM
unless
they
have
excused
absences.
The
electronic
excused
absence
form
can
be
found
online
and
must
be
completed
three
days
prior
to
the
planned
absence.

Tardiness: 
Students
should
arrive

Students
who
are
more
than
10
minutes
late
to
the
lab
without
a
proper
excuse
(excused
absence
form
Ô¨Åled
in

of
the
lab,
nurse
visit,
etc.)
will
be
marked
tardy
AND
will
receive

deduction.
Students
who
are
more
than
30
minutes

will
receive
a
0%

the
lab.
c.
Lab 
Absence: 
If
a
student
has
an
excused
absence
from
the
lab,
they
should
email
the
instructor
and
will
either
be
asked
to
attend
another
section
or
attend
virtually/remotely
if
possible
and
may
be
given
an
alternate
assignment
in
certain
cases.
d.
No 
Headphones: 
Students
who
wear
headphones
or
use
electronic
devices
during
class
in
lieu
of
actively
participating
(as
deÔ¨Åned
by
the
instructor)
will
be
counted
as
absent.","What is the recommended way to study physics to avoid poor test scores?
