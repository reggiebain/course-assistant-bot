Chunk 6:
a.
Group 
vs. 
Individual 
Work: 
Students
are
encouraged
to
work
together
with
classmates
but
must
ensure
that
they
gain
their
own
individual
understanding
of
material.
Students
must
allot
time
for
self-study
alone
without
others.
b.
Don’t 
Procrastinate: 
I
recommend
that
students
make
time
each
day
to
work
on
problem
sets
in
advance
of
the
deadline.
Cramming
the
night
before
an
assignment
or
exam
is
an
ineﬀective
way
to
learn
physics
and
will
result
in
poor
test
scores.
Physics
demands
a
daily,
systematic,
and
focused
approach
to
studying.
c.
Practice 
makes 
perfect: 
Solving
physics
problems
is
a
skill
that
requires
practice.
It
is
NOT
a
game
of
memorizing
equations
or
solutions
to
speciﬁc
problems.
V.
Course
Policies
1.
Prerequisites/Co-requisites
a.
Initial
math

and
labs
at
GSSM
unless
they
have
excused
absences.
The
electronic
excused
absence
form
can
be
found
online
and
must
be

and
lab.
Students
who
are
more
than
10
minutes
late
to
the
lab
without
a
proper
excuse
(excused
absence
form
ﬁled
in
advance
of
the
lab,
nurse
visit,
etc.)
will
be
marked
tardy
AND
will
receive
an
automatic
15
point
deduction.
Students
who
are
more
than
30
minutes
late
for
the
lab
will
receive
a
0%
on
the
lab.
c.
Lab 
Absence: 
If
a
student
has
an
excused
absence
from
the
lab,
they
should
email
the
instructor
and
will
either
be
asked
to
attend
another
section
or
attend
virtually/remotely
if
possible
and
may
be
given
an
alternate
assignment
in
certain
cases.
d.
No 
Headphones: 
Students
who
wear
headphones
or
use
electronic
devices
during
class
in
lieu
of
actively
participating
(as
deﬁned
by
the
instructor)
will
be
counted
as
absent.

Chunk 7:
in
certain
cases.
d.
No 
Headphones: 
Students
who
wear
headphones
or
use
electronic
devices
during
class
in
lieu
of
actively
participating
(as
deﬁned
by
the
instructor)
will
be
counted
as
absent.
Unless
the
instructor
has
asked
students
to
use
electronic
devices
for
academic
purposes,
their
use
is
not
allowed.
Wearing
headphones
during
class/lab
is
prohibited.
e.
Clickers: 
This
class
is
designed
to
be
student-centered
and
highly
interactive.
Students
are
expected
to
actively
participate
during
every
class.
This
includes
answering
any
and
all
clicker-style
poll
questions
using
provided
TurningPoint
clickers,
solving
“Follow-Up”
problems
individually
and
in
small
groups
(written
solutions
will
occasionally
be
collected
for
grading),
participating
in
group
and
class
discussions,
and
completing
in-class
assignments.
Failure
to
actively
participate
during
class
will
incur
a
grade
penalty.

before
each
class
period.
4.
Missed/Late
Assignments
a.
Missed/late 
assignments 
without 
an 
o ﬃ cial 
excused 
absence 
will 
receive 
no 
credit. 
If
a
student
will
miss
class
because
of
an
excused
absence,
students
may
request
an
extension
from
the
instructor
beforehand.
They
can
request
this
extension
directly
on
WebAssign.
Extensions 
will 
only 
be 
provided 
for 
excused 
absences. 
Otherwise, 
no 
late 
work 
is 
accepted. 
b.
Valid
excuses
include
classes
missed
due

due
to
other
coursework,
and
running
out
of
time
are
NOT
considered
valid
excuses.
5.
Tests/Exams
a.
How 
they 
are 
administered: 
Unless
speciﬁed
by
documented
special
accommodations
in
advance,
mid-term
exams
will
be
given
during
class
and
must
be
ﬁnished
during
the
53-minute
class
period.
Tests
will
be
completed
on
WebAssign
and
primarily

c.
Make
up
tests:
No
student
is
required
to
take
more
than
three
full-period
tests
on
any
day.
If
a
student
has
more
than
three
tests
scheduled
for
one
day,
they
should
talk
to
their
instructor(s)
no
later
than
48
hours
(2
days)
in
advance.
If
the
instructor(s)
cannot
accommodate
the
request,
the
student
should
consult
the
Senior
Vice
President
for
Residential
to
determine
the
best
course
of
action.
6.
Accommodations
a.
Any
student
with
accommodations
needs
to
have
a
current
plan
on
ﬁle
with
the
Director
of
the
Center
for
Academic
Success
(Ms.
Kyle
Barnett)
and
should
meet
with
their
instructor
at
the
start
of
the
course
to
determine
how
best
to
accommodate
the
plan.
7.
Academic
Integrity
Page

of
8

Chunk 10:
a.
Academic
integrity
is
“a
commitment,
even
in
the
face
of
adversity,
to
six
fundamental
values:
honesty,
trust,
fairness,
respect,
responsibility,
and
courage”
(International
Center
for
Academic
Integrity
website).
A
lack
of
academic
integrity
prevents
students
from
learning
and
undermines
our
community,
and
is
therefore
strictly
prohibited.
GSSM’s
academic
integrity
policy
(as
explained
in
the
GSSM
Student
Handbook)
covers
all
school-related
academic
work,
both
in
and
out
of
class.
b.
Students
who
engage
in
plagiarism/cheating
will
receive
a
0%
on
a
given
assignment/exam
and
will
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action
including
letters
to
parents,
recommendations
to
the
judicial
council,
etc.
Students
may
work
together
on
homework,
in-class
assignments,
and
labs,
but
must
turn
in
their
own
unique
and
individual
work.
Copied
work
will
not
be
accepted
and
will
be
assigned
a
0%.
During
quizzes/exams,
if
a
phone
is
seen
being
used
or
cheating
is
observed,
a
0%
will
be
assigned.
8.
Inclusion
a.
In
this
class,
we
will
all
maintain
a
community
in
which
every
person
feels
welcomed,
valued,
and
respected.
It
is
expected
that
you
will
treat
your
classmates
graciously
and
responsibly
and
that
you
will
show
respect
for
diverse
perspectives,
especially
in
terms
of
race,
gender,
sexuality,
religion,
national
origin, disability
status, and
socioeconomic
status.

Important
Dates
a.
Although

,
I
estimate
that
the
4
major

will
occur
roughly
the
week
of
each

One-week
notice
will
always
be
given
when

will
depend
on
how
