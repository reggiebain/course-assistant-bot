In this course, we'll use the programming language Python with two goals: first, we want to give you a sense of the kinds of creative activities, both directed problem-solving and creative pursuits, that programming can support; and two, we want to introduce you to the fundamental constructs (and associated skills and techniques) of computer programming.Document 4:::\nCourse Format\n\nWhile some of our reserved class periods will be used for interactive lectures where new concepts will be introduced, other days will be reserved for in-depth tutorials where students will be expected to review course materials (recorded lecture videos, slides, and notes) before the class period and during class we will work in small groups to complete an in-depth programming assignment.\n\nThe rough schedule of the course will be (there are some exceptions):\n\nMondays - Lecture Day\n\nWednesdays - Tutorial Day\n\nFridays - Practice Day\n\nFor lecture days, we'll have interactive lectures where we introduce a new topic and focus on building a core understanding. For Tutorial days, you'll work in your tutorial groups to complete an assignment during class time. On Practice+ days, we'll do a little more practice along with previewing the next components of the course.Document 5:::\nWhat kinds of CS-related careers and opportunities are out there?\n\nOffice hours and locations / Zoom links are posted on the shared Google Sheet that we used to signup for tutorials.

An emergency erasure policy; 2. A deliberate Late Waiver policy.\n\nThese two policies are provided to accommodate the myriad situations that students encounter over the life cycle of the class (e.g. student org travel, sickness, etc.).
