Emergency Grade Erasure Policy

The emergency grade erasure policy acknowledges that often times life situations occur that make it impossible to keep up in a course. Do not use this a planning or scheduling device. This is specifically meant to take care of emergencies that happen in your life during the quarter.

Your lowest quiz score (including 0s) is dropped (we keep the best 2 of 3).

Your lowest tutorial score (including 0s) is dropped.

You may not drop the final tutorial (in Week 10).

Your lowest homework score (including 0s) is dropped.

Your lowest 2 mini-quiz scores (including 0s) are dropped.

You may NOT drop project scores.

If you choose to drop an assignment early in the quarter only to find yourself in an emergency situation later in the quarter, you will need to reach out to your Dean of Students in order to arrange for flexibility across all of your coursework.

This policy will be automatically applied at the end of the quarter for all students. No action is required on your part.

Term Spring 2024 Course COMP_SCI 110: Introduction to Computer Programming Prerequisites None Instructor Prof. Connor Bain (connor.bain@northwestern.edu) Lecture Time Monday, Wednesday, & Friday, 10:00am - 10:50am Lecture Location Lutkin Hall Required Materials Zero Cost Course – (All course materials are open educational resources)

Please note that this syllabus is subject to change prior to March 26, 2024.

Reminder: Tuesday, March 26th is a Northwestern Monday!

About the Course

CS 110 is meant as an introduction to the key ideas of computer programming and assumes no prior programming knowledge. In this course, we'll use the programming language Python with two goals: first, we want to give you a sense of the kinds of creative activities, both directed problem-solving and creative pursuits, that programming can support; and two, we want to introduce you to the fundamental constructs (and associated skills and techniques) of computer programming.

Programming is a powerful medium for creative expression: it can be a representational medium, a tool for thinking about problems, a way of amplifying and/or communicating ideas, a means of performing complex calculations over massive datasets, and more. Being a computer scientist is not a prerequisite for creating useful or advanced programs. In fact, most people who write computer programs are not computer scientists, but rather people who occupy a range of professions. Journalists, geographers, sociologists, scientists, artists, musicians, entrepreneurs, researchers, etc., use programming languages to accomplish diverse and specialized goals. And as data and computing increasingly influence and perfuse modern life, understanding the mechanisms (and risks!) that underlie these systems is a valuable modern literacy that is likely to serve you well.","What is the course code for the Introduction to Computer Programming course?
",COMP_SCI 110,/kaggle/input/course-bot-data/documents/cbain_syllabus.md
"Course Staff

This is a very large class and in order to better support each of your learning goals, we have a huge course staff. Our Peer Mentors (PMs) and TAs serve as your first point of contact in the course and you'll each be assigned to a PM/TA throughout the quarter. You can see them on our Course Staff Directory which is available on Canvas.

Course Grading Policy

Your course grade is calculated as follows:

{:.medium} | Tutorials | 10% | | Mini-Quizzes | 5% | | Homeworks | 25% | | 2 Projects | 25% | | 3 Quizzes | 35% |

There will be approximately 1 tutorial, 2 mini-quizzes, and 1 assignment (either homework exercise or project) due per week.

Final grades are assigned on a fixed scale which is set by the registrar's office:

{:.medium} | A | 94 - 100 | | A- | 90 - 93.99 | | B+ | 87 - 89.99 | | B | 84 - 86.99 | | B- | 80 - 83.99 | | C | 70 - 79.99 | | D* | 60 - 69.99 | | F | 0 - 59.99 |

(*) Note that The Graduate School does not recognize D letter grades meaning if you are enrolled in the class as a graduate student, the range for the F grade is 0-69.99.

Final course grades will not be rounded or curved.

We will not use the registrar's final exam time for this class.

Quizzes

There will be three cumulative assessments of your knowledge and practice of the course material administered during our assigned class time (50 minutes). There will be no Final Exam outside of these three quizzes. The tentative dates of these quizzes can be found on our Course Schedule.

Note: because this class is offered by the Computer Science department which is housed in the McCormick School of Engineering, we will still have class during Weinberg's ""Reading Period"".

Homework Grading

Homework will be approximately weekly and is due at the Canvas specified date. You will submit your homework assignments on Canvas.

We will still accept late homework up to 48 hours after the original due date, with a 15% deduction per 24 hour period.","How are final grades assigned in this course?

"Office Hours

Office hours are a crucial component of this course. We have a huge team of TAs/peer mentors whose job is to help you to be successful in the course and find your own power as current and future programmers. That said, it's up to you to take the initiative and cultivate a weekly / bi-weekly practice of going to office hours that works for you and your schedule. This looks different for everyone: some people go to 1-2 office hours sessions per week and finish their homework with a TA or peer mentor nearby (if needed). Other students never go to office hours (though this is rare, as the homeworks and projects are challenging). Also, different people connect with different TAs/peer mentors, so do shop around to find a person with whom you work well.

Office hours are meant to be a time where you can ask questions that you need answered. That being said, we ask that you come to office hours having already thought about the assignment or issue you have been having. Please try your best to come to office hours prepared to ask questions like:

I didn't understand X idea in lecture / tutorial this week. Can you explain it to me?

I'm having trouble finding a good place to start in this week's homework. Can you help?

My laptop won't run this code from class. What am I doing wrong?

My program is returning this error which I've tried to fix. What am I missing?

What courses should I take next after CS 110?

What kinds of CS-related careers and opportunities are out there?

Office hours and locations / Zoom links are posted on the shared Google Sheet that we used to signup for tutorials. It's also linked on our Canvas home page. Some office hours will be in person. Others will be virtual.

","Students should come to office hours with questions about the assignment or issue they have been having, having already thought about it beforehand.",/kaggle/input/course-bot-data/documents/cbain_syllabus.md
"This class or portions of this class will be recorded by the instructor for educational purposes. Your instructor will communicate how members of the class can access the recordings. Portions of the course that contain images, questions or commentary/discussion by students will be edited out of any recordings that are saved beyond the current term.

Exceptions to Class Modality

Class sessions for this course will occur in person. Individual students will not be granted permission to attend remotely except as the result of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodation as determined by AccessibleNU.

Maintaining the health of the community remains our priority. If you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID do not attend class and update your Symptom Tracker application right away to connect with Northwestern’s Case Management Team for guidance on next steps. Also contact the instructor as soon as possible to arrange to complete coursework.

Students who experience a personal emergency should contact the instructor as soon as possible to arrange to complete coursework.

Should public health recommendations prevent in person class from being held on a given day, the instructor or the university will notify students.","Will students be allowed to attend class remotely?

Course Materials and Resources

Course Software

As this is a programming course, we will be using some free software programs and libraries in order to write, debug, and run Python programs. Installing and configuring this software can be a huge hassle, but it is part of the process of developing your computing proficiencies. There are many ways to install Python and its associated libraries on your computer, however, we can only provide support for the methods of installation described in class during Week 1. We will try our best to support student needs, but because of the large number of students in the course, we cannot feasibly support every method of installation.

Please note, you will need a computer capable of running Python 3+ in order to participate in this course. Any Windows/Mac/Linux computer from the last decade should be fine, however, you may encounter difficulties using a Chromebook, iPad, or other non-standard operating system. If you do not have access to the appropriate computing hardware, please let the course staff know as soon as possible so that we can help you make other arrangements.

If you are struggling to get Python and your code editor installed, this is (alas) normal (ask any software engineer). This is also one of the reasons why we have such a big course staff: to troubleshoot individual laptop problems with students.

edSTEM

edSTEM is a Question-and-Answer site like Piazza/Campuswire that allows students to ask questions that can then be answered by either Course Staff or other students in the course.

"The rough schedule of the course will be (there are some exceptions):

Mondays - Lecture Day

Wednesdays - Tutorial Day

Fridays - Practice Day

For lecture days, we'll have interactive lectures where we introduce a new topic and focus on building a core understanding. For Tutorial days, you'll work in your tutorial groups to complete an assignment during class time. On Practice+ days, we'll do a little more practice along with previewing the next components of the course.

When we assign a pre-recorded lecture, students must watch the video before coming to lecture. Organizationally, some topics/modules span multiple lectures.

Tutorial / Study Groups

The best way to learn how to program is by writing lots of programs. To facilitate this, and to provide a more close-knit learning setting within the context of our larger class, you will each take part in weekly tutorial sessions with one of our Peer Mentors (PMs). You will sign up for a Tutorial Group at the end of the first week of class and then, each week of the quarter, you'll work with your group to complete a tutorial under the guidance of a PM/TA.

By completing the tutorials, you will become familiar with the types of strategies you might use to approach problems (which will be closely related to the homework / projects), push you to write lots of programs, and help you assess what you know and don't know so that you can know when to ask for more help in lecture or in office hours.

By completing the tutorials, you will become familiar with the types of strategies you might use to approach problems, write lots of programs, and assess what you know and don't know so that you can know when to ask for more help in lecture or in office hours.

This course is meant to a be a learning community which requires the dedicated participation of all members. Attendance is required for the first Tutorial, but you may choose to submit future tutorials remotely.

If you attend the Tutorial session in-person, work diligently, and make a legitimate attempt (up to the discretion of your Peer Mentor) at completing the assignment, you will receive full-credit. If you choose not to attend in-person, then your assignment will be reviewed for completion and accuracy meaning you may nor may not receive full credit.

If you attend a tutorial session but do not receive credit, you can fill out this Completion Grade Petition form.

We will not accept late tutorial submissions.

Project Grading

There are two larger programming assignments in the course which we will refer to as Projects. These Projects are a significant portion of your course grade and represent quite a bit more work than the usual homework assignments. These assignments will be graded based on a rubric provided with the assignment description.

Late submissions of Projects will not be accepted.

The second project will be due at the start of the university's assigned final exam block for this course which is March 13th at 3pm.

Grading Equity Policies

The course is specifically designed to be academically equitable to all students when it comes to assessment and has two special policies related to grading: 1. An emergency erasure policy; 2. A deliberate Late Waiver policy.","What is the deadline for the second project?
",The second project will be due at the start of the university's assigned final exam block for this course which is March 13th at 3pm.,/kaggle/input/course-bot-data/documents/cbain_syllabus.md
"The second goal of the course is to introduce you to the fundamental constructs of computer programming and how to apply these low-level constructs in creative and useful ways. Learning a programming language is not dissimilar to learning a new spoken/written language–first, you need to understand basic rules like grammar and syntax, then you need exemplar buildings blocks like adjectives, nouns, and prepositions, and only then can you use these ideas together to create computer programs. What this means is that you must dedicate enough time to practicing the basics in order to allow yourself to progressively move to more and more complex programming practice.

Taking this course means committing — for 10 weeks — to attending lectures, tutorials, and office hours, turning in assignments / projects, doing (lots of) practice problems, and most importantly, persevering when things get difficult. Asking questions throughout the class is not a sign of weakness–it shows that you are actively trying to understand what you know and what you do not know. We have an excellent staff of teaching assistants and peer mentors who are here to answer your questions, help you understand course material in different ways, and push you to your fullest learning potential. With your consistent and active participation in learning, you can navigate the material in the course and become a proficient programmer by the end of the quarter.

Course Format

While some of our reserved class periods will be used for interactive lectures where new concepts will be introduced, other days will be reserved for in-depth tutorials where students will be expected to review course materials (recorded lecture videos, slides, and notes) before the class period and during class we will work in small groups to complete an in-depth programming assignment.

Policy on Academic Honesty

In the past, there have been incidents in which students have presented work other than their own. For the programming assignments: you are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working “together” and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable. Here are some specific guidelines to make sure you don’t cross the line:

Do not exchange programs or program fragments in any form – on paper, via e-mail, or by other means.

Do not copy solutions from any source, including the web or previous CS 110 students.

Do not use auto-generated code as part of your solutions to homeworks and projects.

While working with other students, it is perfectly acceptable to ‘look’ at each other’s code (perhaps while helping someone to debug), but you should NEVER be scribing (typing or writing) your own work while looking at someone else’s (on a computer screen, paper, whiteboard, etc.).","Who is it not acceptable to use auto-generated code as part of your solutions to homeworks and projects?
