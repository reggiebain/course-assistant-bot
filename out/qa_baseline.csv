7,"What is the recommended way to study physics to avoid poor test scores?
","
According to Document 1, line b, the recommended way to study physics to avoid poor test scores is to make time each day to work on problem sets in advance of the deadline and not procrastinate. Additionally, Document 2 suggests using a variety of simulations, watching online physics videos, and potentially being assigned additional reading from outside resources as additional course resources. It's also important to note that physics demands a daily, systematic, and focused approach to studying, as mentioned in Document 0, line c. Practicing physics problems is also crucial, as stated in Document 0, line c, as it requires practice to develop the necessary skills. Overall, consistent and deliberate study habits are essential for success in physics.","The recommended way to study physics is to make time each day to work on problem sets in advance of the deadline and adopt a daily, systematic, and focused approach to studying. Cramming the night before an assignment or exam is not effective."
8,"What should students bring to the exam according to the instructor?
","
According to the instructions provided in Documents 0, 1, 2, and 5, students should bring a writing utensil, either a notebook or a tablet for taking notes and entering answers on WebAssign, and a phone for scanning or uploading written work. Additionally, in Document 2, students should bring a laptop if possible, as one person per group should bring a laptop for Google Docs, Google Sheets, or LoggerPro. In Document 6, students should bring an AP approved calculator, as well as a formula sheet and scratch paper, which will be provided. It's important to note that students should not use their phones or laptops during class, except for scanning or uploading written work, and should come to office hours with specific questions or issues after trying the homework first. The instructor may also ask students to attend another section or attend virtually/remotely in certain cases.","Students should bring a writing utensil, a laptop/tablet for entering answers on WebAssign, a phone to scan/upload any written work for free response questions, an AP approved calculator, and a formula sheet."
