Academic
integrity
is
“a
commitment,
even
in
the
face
of
adversity,
to
six
fundamental
values:
honesty,
trust,
fairness,
respect,
responsibility,
and
courage”
(International
Center
for
Academic
Integrity
website).
A
lack
of
academic
integrity
prevents
students
from
learning
and
undermines
our
community,
and
is
therefore
strictly
prohibited.
GSSM’s
academic
integrity
policy
(as
explained
in
the
GSSM
Student
Handbook)
covers
all
school-related
academic
work,
both
in
and
out
of
class.
b.
Students
who
engage
in
plagiarism/cheating
will
receive
a
0%
on
a
given
assignment/exam
and
will
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action
including
letters
to
parents,
recommendations
to
the
judicial
council,
etc.
Students
may
work
together
on
homework,
in-class
assignments,
and
labs,
but
must
turn
in
their
own
unique
and
individual
work.
Copied
work
will
not
be
accepted
and
will
be
assigned
a
0%.
During
quizzes/exams,
if
a
phone
is
seen
being
used
or
cheating
is
observed,
a
0%
will
be
assigned.

Inclusion
a.
In
this
class,
we
will
all
maintain
a
community
in
which
every
person
feels
welcomed,
valued,
and
respected.
It
is
expected
that
you
will
treat
your
classmates
graciously
and
responsibly
and
that
you
will
show
respect
for
diverse
perspectives,
especially
in
terms
of
race,
gender,
sexuality,
religion,
national
origin, disability
status, and
socioeconomic
status.

Dates
a.
Although
TEST
DATES
ARE
SUBJECT
TO
CHANGE
,
I
estimate
that
the
4
major
tests
will
occur
roughly
the
week
of
each
of
the
dates
below.
One-week
notice
will
always
be
given
when
exam
dates
are
ﬁnalized.
These
dates
will
depend
on
how
the
class
is
performing,
days
missed
due
to
extreme

etc.

Approximation
of","What are the six fundamental values of academic integrity?
","The six fundamental values of academic integrity are honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage.",/kaggle/input/course-bot-data/bain_syllabus.pdf,5.0,"The context explicitly states the six fundamental values of academic integrity, which are honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, and courage.
