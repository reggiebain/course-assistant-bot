Many of each violation type below were reported to the Dean's Office last quarter alone.", "These two policies are provided to accommodate the myriad situations that students encounter over the life cycle of the class (e.g. student org travel, sickness, etc.).

As a community, we aim to be respectful to all learners in this class, regardless of race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, religion, gender identity, or sexual orientation. There will be an optional survey administered at the beginning of the quarter asking you to provide the name and pronouns that you use. This information will be shared with all members of the instructional staff. You are welcome to correct us on your name or preferred pronouns if a mistake is made.

Document 2 compares learning to program to learning a new language, emphasizing the importance of mastering basic rules and building blocks before moving on to more complex programming practices. Document 3 highlights the importance of designing and reasoning about programs, as programs rarely work perfectly the first time and understanding the code is crucial for future modifications or collaboration. Document 4 clarifies that this course focuses on core CS concepts rather than teaching a specific programming language, as the ideas learned apply to all programming languages.

Visit the Course Resources page for a Staff Directory of all our amazing course staff members!\n\nPeer Mentors\n\nOur Peer Mentors (PMs) serve as your first point of contact in the course. PMs will be assigned to tutorial groups so that you can build a relationship with them over the course of the quarter. They will also host office hours each week that will be open for all students. That means that there will be more than 60 office hours offered per week for our course. Please note that you are welcome to attend any office hours that work for your schedule and you\u2019re not limited to your assigned PM\u2019s hours.\n\nGraduate TAs", "About the Course\n\nCourse Format\n\nOffice Hours\n\nCourse Staff\n\nPeer Mentors\n\nGraduate TAs\n\nGrading\n\nMini-quizzes\n\nTutorials\n\nExercises\n\nEthics Modules\n\nQuizzes\n\nGrading Equity\n\nLate Penalty Waiver\n\nEmergency Grade Erasure\n\nCourse Materials and Resources\n\nCourse Software\n\nedSTEM\n\nAuxillary Texts\n\nAcademic Honesty\n\nStatement of Inclusivity\n\nNorthwestern University Syllabus Standards", "By completing the tutorials, you will become familiar with the types of strategies you might use to approach problems , push you to write lots of programs, and help you assess what you know and don\u2019t know so that you can know when to ask for more help in lecture or in office hours.\n\nThis course is meant to a be a learning community which requires the dedicated participation of all members. Attendance is required for the first Tutorial, but you may choose to submit future tutorials remotely.\n\nIf you attend the Tutorial session in-person and make a legitimate attempt (up to the discretion of your Peer Mentor) at completing the assignment, you will receive full-credit. If you choose not to attend in-person, then your assignment will be reviewed for completion and accuracy meaning you may nor may not receive full credit. Remote tutorials will be graded via the same autograding mechanism as the Exercises.", "Graduate TAs\n\nYou can think of our Graduate Teaching Assistants as \u201cSuper PMs!\u201d Not only can they serve as meaningful course resources, but they can also provide broader context to our pedagogical approach, talk more about research opportunities in the field of Computer Science, and address concerns you may not feel comfortable with talking to a peer about.\n\nGrading\n\nYour course grade will consist of 5 weighted components: Tutorials, Exercises, Mini-Quizzes, Ethics Modules and Quizzes. The weights of each component are below:\n\nTutorials (~10) 9% Exercises (~10) 28% Mini Quizzes (~2 per module) 9% Ethics Modules (3) 9% Quizzes (4) 45%", "Office Hours\n\nOffice hours are a crucial component of this course. Everyone on our course staff is here to help you to be successful in the course and find your own power as current and future programmers. That said, it\u2019s up to you to take the initiative and cultivate a weekly / bi-weekly practice of going to office hours that works for you and your schedule. This looks different for everyone: some people go to 1-2 office hours sessions per week and finish their homework with a TA or peer mentor nearby (if needed). Other students never go to office hours (though this is rare, as the exercises are challenging). Also, different people connect with different TAs/peer mentors, so do shop around to find a person with whom you work well.", "Taking this course means committing\u2014for 11 weeks\u2014to attending lectures, tutorials, and office hours, turning in assignments, practicing your programming skills, and most importantly, persevering when things get difficult. Asking questions throughout the class is not a sign of weakness. It shows that you are actively trying to understand what you know and what you do not know. We have an excellent staff of teaching assistants and peer mentors who are here to answer your questions, help you understand course material in different ways, and push you to your fullest learning potential. With your consistent and active participation in learning, you can navigate the material in the course and become a proficient programmer by the end of the quarter.\n\nCourse Format", "If you do not have access to appropriate computing hardware, please let the course staff know as soon as possible so that we can help you make other arrangements either a computing loaner program or arranging for you to use a computer lab on campus.\n\nedSTEM\n\nEd (sometimes called edSTEM) is a Question-and-Answer site that allows students to ask questions that can then be answered by either Course Staff or other students in the course as well as create discussion areas about both related and unrelated topics.\n\nCheck out out the Course Resources page for the registration link.\n\nAuxillary Texts\n\nWhile we will not follow any textbook exactly, we will use two auxiliary texts which can serve as an excellent resource both for students looking for different perspectives on the course content as well as students looking for additional content outside our syllabus (note, both are free to access online):"], "test_settings": "chunk:200_embeddings:thenlper~gte-small_rerank:False_reader-model:zephyr-7b-beta", "eval_score_gpt4": "5", "eval_feedback_gpt4": "The response correctly identifies that the course staff consists of 33 individuals and includes Peer Mentors and Graduate TAs.
