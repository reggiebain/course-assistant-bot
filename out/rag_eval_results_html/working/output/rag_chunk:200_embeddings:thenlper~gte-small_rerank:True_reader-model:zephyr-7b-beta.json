This includes Peer Mentors, Graduate TAs, and Course Staff members. Students are encouraged to visit the Staff Directory to learn more about each member and their roles in the course.", "retrieved_docs": ["Course Staff\n\nThis is a very large class and in order to better support each of your learning goals, we have 33 course staff members. Visit the Course Resources page for a Staff Directory of all our amazing course staff members!\n\nPeer Mentors\n\nOur Peer Mentors (PMs) serve as your first point of contact in the course. PMs will be assigned to tutorial groups so that you can build a relationship with them over the course of the quarter. They will also host office hours each week that will be open for all students. That means that there will be more than 60 office hours offered per week for our course. Please note that you are welcome to attend any office hours that work for your schedule and you\u2019re not limited to your assigned PM\u2019s hours.\n\nGraduate TAs", "Office Hours\n\nOffice hours are a crucial component of this course. Everyone on our course staff is here to help you to be successful in the course and find your own power as current and future programmers. That said, it\u2019s up to you to take the initiative and cultivate a weekly / bi-weekly practice of going to office hours that works for you and your schedule. This looks different for everyone: some people go to 1-2 office hours sessions per week and finish their homework with a TA or peer mentor nearby (if needed). Other students never go to office hours (though this is rare, as the exercises are challenging). Also, different people connect with different TAs/peer mentors, so do shop around to find a person with whom you work well.", "Every student submission is subject to an in-person audit/interview by course staff. If there is any part of your program, both its function and the process by which you designed it, you cannot explain\u2013up to the satisfaction of the instructor\u2013it will be considered a violation of Northwestern\u2019s Academic Integrity policy and you will receive an automatic 0 on the assignment.\n\nFor the programming assignments, you are allowed (encouraged, even!) to discuss general approaches to solving problems, but all work you submit must be your own. Working \u201ctogether\u201d and presenting variants of the same file is not acceptable.\n\nHere are some specific guidelines:\n\nOther than during in-class Tutorial assignments, you should essentially never look at another student\u2019s code.\n\nThe only code you should ever be looking at should have either been posted / generated by the Course Staff or included in one of our auxillary textbooks.", "If you do not have access to appropriate computing hardware, please let the course staff know as soon as possible so that we can help you make other arrangements either a computing loaner program or arranging for you to use a computer lab on campus.\n\nedSTEM\n\nEd (sometimes called edSTEM) is a Question-and-Answer site that allows students to ask questions that can then be answered by either Course Staff or other students in the course as well as create discussion areas about both related and unrelated topics.\n\nCheck out out the Course Resources page for the registration link.\n\nAuxillary Texts\n\nWhile we will not follow any textbook exactly, we will use two auxiliary texts which can serve as an excellent resource both for students looking for different perspectives on the course content as well as students looking for additional content outside our syllabus (note, both are free to access online):", "Taking this course means committing\u2014for 11 weeks\u2014to attending lectures, tutorials, and office hours, turning in assignments, practicing your programming skills, and most importantly, persevering when things get difficult.
