Course Description 1. Course Summary a. PHY 161/PHYS 215 General Physics I is an algebra-based introduction to mechanics,  thermodynamics, and waves. Topics include motion in one and two dimensions,  Newton’s laws of motion, equilibrium, work, energy, momentum, rotational motion,  gravity, heat, waves, and sound. Examples from medicine and biology will be  included whenever possible. 2. College Credit Hours (Dual-Enrollment) a. This course is dual enrolled with PHYS 215 General Physics I at Francis Marion  University (FMU) and taught by a GSSM instructor. Students will each have a FMU  transcript with their overall grade earned in this course. Students may earn up to 4  college credit hours depending on their grade and the transfer policies of their  college/university. Refer to the Dual Enrollment FAQ in the Course Catalog for  more information. 3. Learning Outcomes a. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:  b.

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:  b. Apply the laws of classical Newtonian mechanics (motion, force, energy,  momentum, and gravitation) to solve problems involving static systems, motion  with constant acceleration, and rotational motion.  c. Use techniques of graphical analysis to classify and model physical phenomena and  apply physical meaning to mathematical techniques from algebra, pre-calculus, and  trigonometry.

Collect, analyze, and present scientiﬁc data through weekly labs, data-focused  problems, and technical writing tasks.  4. Pedagogy a. This course will help students develop key problem-solving and critical thinking skills  through a student-centered, active approach to learning. The course will incorporate  guided, inquiry-based activities, group problem-solving, and peer-instruction in order to  promote active student engagement. II. Laboratory 1. Learning Outcomes a. Lab oﬀers students the chance to gain interactive experience with scientiﬁc principles,  develop their data collection/analysis skills, and work collaboratively with other students  to complete experiments and solve problems as a group.  b.

Assignments a. Students will complete weekly lab assignments that will be written in Google Docs and  utilize Google Sheets extensively. Most labs will be submitted electronically to Canvas but  some will be written by hand. Some activities will require students to work in groups of  3-4 and others will require students to turn in work individually. During most weeks, the  assignment should be completed and submitted during the lab period.  b.

Giancoli — Primary text for  course. A physical copy is provided to students.  b. OpenStax College Physics — An additional free e-textbook will be provided to students on  Canvas as an additional course resource.  c. Additional Resources — Students will be asked to use a wide variety of simulations, watch  online physics videos, and may be assigned additional reading from resources outside the  test above. Such readings and assignments will be provided on Canvas and with each  WebAssign homework assignment. 2.
